* computational complexity
   * time / space
       * best / average / worst
   * what is the computational complexity of common algorithms?
   * sort algorithms
        * bubble sort
        * insertion sort
        * merge sort
        * bogo sort
   * search
* Timing
   * Use %timit in the python intepretor or the time module
* profiling
   * https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile
* In groups of 3-4
    * develop your high-precision data type
    * pseudocode for high precision floating point object
    * should include methods for arithmatic +,-,*,/ and comparisons.
    * Choose any algorithm where you can demonstrate the numerical precision is a limiting factor for standard double precision floating point objects and compare to your class.
* Next Tuesday
    * Project 2
    * Monte-carlo methods 
    * Random numbers 
        * pseudorandom numbers
        * drawing from specific distributions
            * Using the inverse CDF
            * Using rejection sampling
