* Discussion of Harmonic Oscillator
* python types continued
    * tuples, dictionaries, lists
    * numpy
* packages
* classes (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
    * inheritence
        * https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance
    * common methods
    * special methods
        * operators
        * https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html
* Start on computational complexity
    * time / space
       * best / average / worst
    * what is the computational complexity of common algorithms?
    * search
    * time complexity in python
        * https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
* In groups of 3-4
    * Plan pseudocode for high precision floating point object
    * should include methods for arithmatic +,-,*,/ and comparisons.
    * Choose any algorithm where you can demonstrate the numerical precision
      is a limiting factor for standard double precision floating point objects
      and compare to your class.
* Next Thursday
    * More on computational complexity
    * Project 1 is due!
