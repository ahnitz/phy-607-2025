* Timing
   * Use %timit in the python intepretor
   * Time your script or algorithm that demonstrates your high-precision type
* profiling
   * https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile
* numpy arrays
* Monte-carlo simulations
* Random numbers
    * pseudorandom numbers
    * drawing from specific distributions
        * Using the inverse CDF
        * Using rejection sampling
* [in-class group work]
    Implement sorting algorithm that works with your extended precision class.
    * Implement both a bubble sort and a merger sort
    * Split the implementation between the group
    * Before next class post a plot comparing the time it takes to sort
      a list for both algorithms as a function of list length.
* Project 2 is posted
