* Project 3 intro
* Comparison of models
* MCMC
    * metropolis hastings
    * burn-in
    * autocorrelation
    * convergence
        * Gelman-Rubin statistic
    * ensemble sampling
* in-class work, work in groups of 2-3
    * Write a likelihood assuming the data contains your model plus additive
      Gaussian (unit variance) noise.
    * write a 500 walker ensemble MCMC and run for 1000 iterations
    * Plot the distribution of the walker positons after every 100 iterations.
      How does the distribution evolve?
      Has the distribution converged?
* Assignment out of class
    * Read through the roundtable discussion PDF on mcmc in practice.
* Next class
    * Add tests of convergence to your example model
