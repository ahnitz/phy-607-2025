* Interactive Tutorial
    * This will be done in groups of 3-4
        * Two members should work be primarily responsible for the interactive
          tutorial development, while 1-2 should be responsible for the 
          presentation. 
        * Each should contribute equally to helping the class understand and
          use your tutorials. 
    * Elements
        * choose an computational algorithm, library, or tool to explain to the
          class. It should not be a topic we directly covered in class.
            * you might demonstrate the use of a particular library
               (e.g. pytorch, scipy, etc).
            * you might demonstrate an algorithm that is useful in physics
               * fourier transforms, PDEs, etc.
            * you may ask your research group if applicable for ideas
        * create a short tutorial (no more than 15 minutes)
            * The tutorial should have some explanation and relate how the topic
              might be used or relate to physics.
            * The tutorial should have a single problem for the class to work out
              that involves writing a (small) amount of code. Try to make sure
              this can be worked out in ~ 10-15 minutes in class.
            * Work out a solution yourself but do not provide
              the solution initially.
        * The tutorial should be developmed in git and the class should
          access the tutorial by clone the git repository.
    * Time allocation
        * 10-15 minutes to explain the concept and introduce the tutorial
        * 20 minutes, assist class members in completing your tutorial challenge
          problem.
        * 5 minutes walk through your solution to the problem
    * You will be graded on completing the elements of your tutorial and your
      participation in completeing the other group's tutorials
    * Group tutorials will be given Dec 4th, 9th, and 15th (final exam period).
